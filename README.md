Practice Morse uses a LilyGo TTGO T-Display to make a Morse code tester. 
A piezo speaker is connected plus to pin 26 and negative to Ground.
A 3.5mm female connector is connected tip (dot) to pin 13, R1 (dash) to 
pin 12, R2 to Ground. A morse paddle can be plugged into the 3.5mm connector. 

A big thank you goes to W.Kraml (OE1WKL) for sharing his code for the 
Morserino-32. I used his code as a base to start from.

Practice Morse has CW Keyer, CW Generator, Echo Trainer and Koch Trainer
functions.

I created a 3D printed box to hold the components along with a Lipo battery.
